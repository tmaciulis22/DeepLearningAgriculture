# DeepLearningAgriculture
A team project developed during Deep Learning course at Vilnius University. It's aim is to research how current state-of-the-art image segmentation models are effective on segmenting various segments (weed clusters, nutrient deficiency etc.) related to agriculture.  
  
Dataset is taken from [Agriculture-Vision challenge repository](https://github.com/SHI-Labs/Agriculture-Vision)  
  
More information is available in technical report pdf file (in Lithuanian language).
